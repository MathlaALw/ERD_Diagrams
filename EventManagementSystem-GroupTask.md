# Event Management System (Advanced)   - Group Task

## Event Management System Requirements

- **Organizers create events, which may include multiple parallel sessions.**
- **Attendees register and select sessions they plan to attend.**
- **Each session is held in a specific room, has a speaker, and may have prerequisite 
sessions.**
- **Track RSVP status (confirmed, tentative, canceled), actual attendance, and 
feedback per session.**
- **Some events are ticketed, and tickets may have tiers (VIP, Standard) with price 
differences.**
- **Each event can have sponsors, promotional materials, and registration deadlines.**
